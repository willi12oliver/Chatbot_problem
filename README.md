I'm currently working on integrating a chatbot automation system into my website using GitHub Actions, but I'm encountering some challenges. Specifically, I'm having trouble with configuring the GitHub Actions workflow to properly handle updates to the chatbot. The issue seems to be related to ensuring that the chatbot's new features and fixes are deployed smoothly without disrupting the existing functionality.
I have followed various tutorials and best practices, but I’m still facing issues with automating these updates. I &nbsp;greatly appreciate any advice or insights from those who have experience with similar integrations. If you could take a look at my GitHub repository, it includes the configuration and details of the setup I’m working on <a rel="noopener"><strong>Wallsend Medical Practices</strong></a> &nbsp;thank you in advance for any help you can provide.
